# Advent of Code 2019

Solutions to the first few problems from 2019's Advent of Code.

## What is Advent of Code?

From the official website (https://adventofcode.com/2019/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Viewing and running the solutions

The solutions in this repository are each contained in a single file, and are named after the 'day' of the Advent challenge that they solve (e.g. ```day_two.py```).

To run the solutions:

1. Download the ```src``` folder in this repository
2. Navigate to the downloaded folder using a shell
3. Input the command: ```python <filename>.py```, replacing ```<filename>``` with the name of the file that you wish to run

Note that as each problem is split into two parts, with the second typically building upon the first, solutions that have been fully completed will only show the output for the second part when run.
